; For a given list with  integers, return a new list removing the elements at odd positions. The input and output portions will be handled automatically. You need to write a function with the recommended method signature.
; Input Format
;  integers contained in the list, each on a separate line.
; Output Format
; Output the list with the integers at odd positions removed i.e. the first element, the third element and so on. The relative positions of the remaining even-position elements should be the same as they were in the original array. Each integer will be on a separate line.
